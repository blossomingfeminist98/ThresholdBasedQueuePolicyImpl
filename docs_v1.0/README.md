## Threshold Based Queueing Policy Implementation 
The Overall goal of this project is to implement threshold based queueing policy in minimal number of AQM capable Internet Routers for congestion control. A multiple bottleneck network has been chosen which represents an autonomous system within the Internet. This policy has been implemented in multiple bottleneck topology with both homogeneous and heterogeneous traffic type. All the simulations have been executed in NS3 Simulator (version 3.36). The simulation scripts have written in C++. Apart from the simulation scripts, we have used bash and python scripts in this project.
